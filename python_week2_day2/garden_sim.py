# Garden simulator
#
# Create the following classes to simulate a garden:
#     - `Tree` - its shade decreases water loss by `2`
#     - `Gnome` - each instance adds a `5%` chance of rain
#     - `Woodchuck` - creates a `5%` chance of a `Tree` disappearing
#     - `Garden` - has separate lists for instances of `Tree`, `Gnome`, and `Woodchuck`
#
#   Create a main `while` loop that runs your simulator.
#   During each turn, your `Garden` may experience rain, or may have a `Woodchuck` move in.
#   For each of its lists, tally up the various percents that an event will occur and
#   use the built-in `random` module to decide what happens during that turn.
#   (See https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/random.html for more information)
#
#   Every 10th turn, you have a random chance of earning another `Tree` or `Gnome`.
#
#   The simulation ends if you reach `10` `Tree` instances.
#
#   Adding more classes
#
#     - `FruitTree` (a subclass of `Tree`) - after its `water_level` reaches `100`, it should increase its `fruit` attribute by `1`
#     - `Squirrel` - each one adds a 5% chance that your `fruit` levels will decrease by `1`.
#
# The simulation ends if your `FruitTree` instances are able produce `10` fruits.
